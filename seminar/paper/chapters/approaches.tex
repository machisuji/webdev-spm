\section{Extending Cloud9}
\label{sec:Approaches}
During the development of our sample application \emph{Tetris} we figured three major issues out that troubled our development work flow.

\subsection{Collaboration}
As mentioned in \needcite[somewhere in motivation] 

\begin{itemize}
	\item our 3 approaches, and what we have choosen
	\item mention version control systems in general, git
\end{itemize}


Collaboration
	See what other team members do in real-time
	But: will be released in ~3 weeks
IDE-based Issue-Tracking
	Measure time and assign to tickets
	Automatically create tickets while coding
Proper git integration in editor / IDE
	Work without console
	Visualize changes
	(Branches, History, Tags, â€¦)
